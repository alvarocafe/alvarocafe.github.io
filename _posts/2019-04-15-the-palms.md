title: "Inside the palms"

This night I went to the <a href="http://www.emb.se.df.gov.br/cepemb/historico" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EMB</a>  theater
 to listen to <a href="http://embassybrasilia.com.br/site/the-palms/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> the palms</a>. It's so good to hear to the theater, its resonance mixing the choirs' voices, each wall reverberating, each voice reverberating, pulsating like an old synthesizer.

The human voice is an incredible instrument. For the purposes of music, the vocal apparatus is able to act into the whole range of audible frequency, from the large band-white noise sounds like in "shame" to the low register notes. The mix in a theater is very differente than the mix from audio recordings. First of all, the mix of sounds heard in a room is passive, which means there's no control from humans, the room is mixing the sound and reverberating on its own, no humans required. The amplitude of each note is carefully controlled by the singer after carefull practice. The distance from which I heard was about 100 meters, which means sound from the musicians took a third of a second to reach me. The theater was about 150 meters long, which was its biggest dimension, so the first reverberation was about 58 ms after the first notes. This is supposed to be noticeable, but the core of the sound was diffuse, as human bodies scattered the sound around, no distinct echoing was audible, just the constant rumble and sporadic rays of melodical intervention.

There's clear distinction between live and recorded music. Listening to a live concert means listening to the venue as much as listening to the artist. This has been long discussed as period venues are often still used for the music it was originally written for, even if newer more acoustically technologically "advanced" rooms exists. This point is further carried out by David Byrne in his talk about the mutual influence of architecture and music.

The experience of listening to live music is very difficult to describe, it's similar to trying to describe someone's voice. It's not the voice we'll end up describing, but its shadows and textures. This doesn't mean live music is better in any way, it just mean we owe to this theaters and to ourselves to listen to their voices. They have a lot to tell us.
