title: "Science under siege"

There's a threat to brazilian science going on since before the Bolsonaro's election, but now the new education minister is public threateaning University of Brasília (UnB). After a huge success with 18 new universities and a large inclusion of historically neglected people by means of legal action, i.e. structural racism, conservative reaction has quickly started to corrode this achievements. Bolsonaro's election last october has since been an attack on intellectualism. Days before completing its 100th day, former minister of education Ricardo Vélez has been fired after many scandals which included asking for elementary school teachers to videorecord students saying the governments logo and send it to the ministry of education (MEC).

Now, it seems Bolsonaro has not taken the hint the brazilian people does not want a conspiracionist for minister and named Abraham Weintraub who has shown even more dictatorial tendencies. Yesterday, he freezed accounts for three universities, including my own, University of Brasília (UnB) summing up to 30% of total budget. This has been interpreted as retaliation for the universities active politic role on society, hosting debates with Fernando Haddad and Guilherme Boulos, who runned against Bolsonaro last elections for president.

This kind of antidemocratic actions cannot be tolerated, so undergraduate and graduate students, alongside professors are speaking out against it. Today is already May 1st, labour day. The backbone of innovation is done in federal universities in Brazil. This are public universities which produce top quality research. Let's not let them die.
